   <h3 class="title">PEAR</h3>
   <p class="para">
    <a href="http://pear.php.net/" class="link external">&raquo;&nbsp;PEAR</a>, the <em>PHP Extension and
    Application Repository</em> (originally, PHP Extension and Add-on
    Repository) is PHP&#039;s version of foundation classes, and may grow in
    the future to be one of the key ways to distribute PHP extensions among
    developers.
   </p>
   <p class="para">
    PEAR was born in discussions held in the PHP Developers&#039;
    Meeting (PDM) held in January 2000 in Tel Aviv. It was
    created by Stig S. Bakken, and is dedicated to his first-born
    daughter, Malin Bakken.
   </p>
   <p class="para">
    Since early 2000, PEAR has grown to be a big, significant
    project with a large number of developers working on
    implementing common, reusable functionality for the
    benefit of the entire PHP community. PEAR today includes
    a wide variety of infrastructure foundation classes
    for database access, content caching, mathematical
    calculations, eCommerce and much more.

   <h3 class="title">PHP Quality Assurance Initiative</h3>
   <p class="para">
    The <a href="http://qa.php.net/" class="link external">&raquo;&nbsp;PHP Quality Assurance
    Initiative</a> was set up in the summer of 2000 in response to
    criticism that PHP releases were not being tested well enough for
    production environments. The team now consists of a core group of
    developers with a good understanding of the PHP code
    base. These developers spend a lot of their time
    localizing and fixing bugs within PHP. In addition
    there are many other team members who test and
    provide feedback on these fixes using a wide variety
    of platforms.

   <h3 class="title">PHP-GTK</h3>
   <p class="para">
    <a href="http://gtk.php.net/" class="link external">&raquo;&nbsp;PHP-GTK</a> is the PHP solution for
    writing client side GUI applications. Andrei Zmievski remembers the
    planing and creation process of PHP-GTK:
   </p>
   <blockquote class="blockquote">
    <p class="para">
     GUI programming has always been of my interests, and I found
     that Gtk+ is a very nice toolkit, except that programming with
     it in C is somewhat tedious. After witnessing PyGtk and GTK-Perl
     implementations, I decided to see if PHP could be made to
     interface with Gtk+, even minimally. Starting in August of 2000,
     I began to have a bit more free time so that is when I started
     experimenting. My main guideline was the PyGtk implementation
     as it was fairly feature complete and had a nice object-oriented
     interface. James Henstridge, the author of PyGtk, provided very
     helpful advice during those initial stages.
    </p>
    <p class="para">
     Hand-writing the interfaces to all the Gtk+ functions was out of
     the question, so I seized upon the idea of code-generator, similar
     to how PyGtk did it. The code generator is a PHP program that reads
     a set of <var class="filename">.defs</var> file containing the Gtk+ classes, constants, and
     methods information and generates C code that interfaces PHP with
     them. What cannot be generated automatically can be written by
     hand in <var class="filename">.overrides</var> file.
    </p>
    <p class="para">
     Working on the code generator and the infrastructure took some
     time, because I could spend little time on PHP-GTK during the
     fall of 2000. After I showed PHP-GTK to Frank Kromann, he got
     interested and started helping me out with code generator work
     and Win32 implementation. When we wrote the first Hello World
     program and fired it up, it was extremely exciting. It took a
     couple more months to get the project to a presentable condition
     and the initial version was released on March 1, 2001. The
     story promptly hit SlashDot.
    </p>
    <p class="para">
     Sensing that PHP-GTK might be extensive, I set up separate
     mailing lists and CVS repositories for it, as well as the
     gtk.php.net website with the help of Colin Viebrock. The
     documentation would also need to be done and James Moore
     came in to help with that.
    </p>
    <p class="para">
     Since its release PHP-GTK has been gaining popularity. We
     have our own documentation team, the manual keeps improving,
     people start writing extensions for PHP-GTK, and more and
     more exciting applications with it.
