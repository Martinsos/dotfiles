  <h2 class="title">Assertions</h2>
  <p class="para">
   An assertion is  a  test  on  the  characters  following  or
   preceding  the current matching point that does not actually
   consume any characters. The simple assertions coded  as  \b,
   \B,  \A,  \Z,  \z, ^ and $ are described above. More complicated
   assertions are coded as  subpatterns.  There  are  two
   kinds:  those that <em class="emphasis">look ahead</em> of the current position in the
   subject string, and those that <em class="emphasis">look behind</em> it.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   An assertion subpattern is matched in the normal way, except
   that  it  does not cause the current matching position to be
   changed. <em class="emphasis">Lookahead</em> assertions start with  (?=  for  positive
   assertions and (?! for negative assertions. For example,
   
   <em>\w+(?=;)</em>
   
   matches a word followed by a semicolon, but does not include
   the semicolon in the match, and
   
   <em>foo(?!bar)</em>
   
   matches any occurrence of &quot;foo&quot;  that  is  not  followed  by
   &quot;bar&quot;. Note that the apparently similar pattern
   
   <em>(?!foo)bar</em>
   
   does not find an occurrence of &quot;bar&quot;  that  is  preceded  by
   something other than &quot;foo&quot;; it finds any occurrence of &quot;bar&quot;
   whatsoever, because the assertion  (?!foo)  is  always  <strong><code>TRUE</code></strong>
   when  the  next  three  characters  are  &quot;bar&quot;. A lookbehind
   assertion is needed to achieve this effect.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   <em class="emphasis">Lookbehind</em> assertions start with (?&lt;=  for  positive  assertions
   and (?&lt;! for negative assertions. For example,
   
   <em>(?&lt;!foo)bar</em>
   
   does find an occurrence of &quot;bar&quot; that  is  not  preceded  by
   &quot;foo&quot;. The contents of a lookbehind assertion are restricted
   such that all the strings  it  matches  must  have  a  fixed
   length.  However, if there are several alternatives, they do
   not all have to have the same fixed length. Thus
   
   <em>(?&lt;=bullock|donkey)</em>
   
   is permitted, but
   
   <em>(?&lt;!dogs?|cats?)</em>
   
   causes an error at compile time. Branches  that  match  different
   length strings are permitted only at the top level of
   a lookbehind assertion. This is an extension  compared  with
   Perl  5.005,  which  requires all branches to match the same
   length of string. An assertion such as
   
   <em>(?&lt;=ab(c|de))</em>
   
   is not permitted, because its single  top-level  branch  can
   match two different lengths, but it is acceptable if rewritten
   to use two top-level branches:
   
   <em>(?&lt;=abc|abde)</em>
   
   The implementation of lookbehind  assertions  is,  for  each
   alternative,  to  temporarily move the current position back
   by the fixed width and then  try  to  match.  If  there  are
   insufficient  characters  before  the  current position, the
   match is deemed to fail.  Lookbehinds  in  conjunction  with
   once-only  subpatterns can be particularly useful for matching
   at the ends of strings; an example is given at  the  end
   of the section on once-only subpatterns.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   Several assertions (of any sort) may  occur  in  succession.
   For example,
   
   <em>(?&lt;=\d{3})(?&lt;!999)foo</em>
   
   matches &quot;foo&quot; preceded by three digits that are  not  &quot;999&quot;.
   Notice  that each of the assertions is applied independently
   at the same point in the subject string. First  there  is  a
   check  that  the  previous  three characters are all digits,
   then there is a check that the same three characters are not
   &quot;999&quot;.   This  pattern  does not match &quot;foo&quot; preceded by six
   characters, the first of which are digits and the last three
   of  which  are  not  &quot;999&quot;.  For  example,  it doesn&#039;t match
   &quot;123abcfoo&quot;. A pattern to do that is
   
   <em>(?&lt;=\d{3}...)(?&lt;!999)foo</em>
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   This time the first assertion looks  at  the  preceding  six
   characters,  checking  that  the first three are digits, and
   then the second assertion checks that  the  preceding  three
   characters are not &quot;999&quot;.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   Assertions can be nested in any combination. For example,
   
   <em>(?&lt;=(?&lt;!foo)bar)baz</em>
   
   matches an occurrence of &quot;baz&quot; that  is  preceded  by  &quot;bar&quot;
   which in turn is not preceded by &quot;foo&quot;, while
   
   <em>(?&lt;=\d{3}...(?&lt;!999))foo</em>
   
   is another pattern which matches  &quot;foo&quot;  preceded  by  three
   digits and any three characters that are not &quot;999&quot;.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   Assertion subpatterns are not capturing subpatterns, and may
   not  be  repeated,  because  it makes no sense to assert the
   same thing several times. If any kind of assertion  contains
   capturing  subpatterns  within it, these are counted for the
   purposes of numbering the capturing subpatterns in the whole
   pattern.   However,  substring capturing is carried out only
   for positive assertions, because it does not make sense  for
   negative assertions.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   Assertions count towards the maximum  of  200  parenthesized
   subpatterns.
