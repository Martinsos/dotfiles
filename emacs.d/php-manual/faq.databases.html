      On Windows machines, you can simply use the included ODBC support
      and the correct ODBC driver.
     </p>
     <p class="para">
      On Unix machines, you can use the Sybase-CT driver
      to access Microsoft SQL Servers because they are (at
      least mostly) protocol-compatible. Sybase has made a
      <a href="http://www.php.net/extra/ctlib-linux-elf.tar.gz" class="link external">&raquo;&nbsp;free version of the necessary
      libraries for Linux systems</a>. For other Unix operating
      systems, you need to contact Sybase for the correct libraries.

     <p class="para">
      Yes. You already have all the tools you need if you are running
      entirely under Windows 9x/Me, or NT/2000, where you can use
      ODBC and Microsoft&#039;s ODBC drivers for Microsoft Access databases.
     </p>
     <p class="para">
      If you are running PHP on a Unix box and want to talk to MS Access
      on a Windows box you will need Unix ODBC drivers.
      <a href="http://www.openlinksw.com/" class="link external">&raquo;&nbsp;OpenLink Software</a> has Unix-based
      ODBC drivers that can do this.
     </p>
     <p class="para">
      Another alternative is to use an SQL server that has
      Windows ODBC drivers and use that to store the data, which you can
      then access from Microsoft Access (using ODBC) and PHP (using the
      built in drivers), or to use an intermediary file format that Access
      and PHP both understand, such as flat files or dBase databases.
      On this point Tim Hayes from OpenLink software writes:
      <blockquote class="blockquote">
       <p class="para">
        Using another database as an intermediary is not a good idea, when you can
        use ODBC from PHP straight to your database - i.e. with OpenLink&#039;s drivers. If
        you do need to use an intermediary file format, OpenLink have now released
        Virtuoso (a virtual database engine) for NT, Linux and other Unix platforms.

      There are three MySQL extensions, as described under the

      should not be used, and one day it will be deprecated and eventually removed from PHP.
      It is a popular extension so this will be a slow process, but you are strongly encouraged
      to write all new code with either <a href="book.mysqli.html" class="link">mysqli</a> or
      <a href="ref.pdo-mysql.html" class="link">PDO_MySQL</a>.

      Migration scripts are not available at this time, although the mysqli API contains both
      a procedural and OOP API, with the procedural version being similar to ext/mysql.

      It is not possible to mix the extensions. So, for example, passing a mysqli connection to

      PHP 5 no longer bundles MySQL client libraries, what does this mean to

    <dd class="answer">

      Yes.  There will always be MySQL support in PHP of one kind or
      another.  The only change in PHP 5 is that we are no longer bundling
      the client library itself.  Some reasons in no particular order:
     </p>
     <ul class="itemizedlist">
      <li class="listitem">

        Most systems these days already have the client library installed.

        Given the above, having multiple versions of the library can get
        messy.  For example, if you link mod_auth_mysql against one version
        and PHP against another, and then enable both in Apache, you get a
        nice fat crash.  Also, the bundled library didn&#039;t always play well
        with the installed server version.  The most obvious symptom of this
        being disagreement over where to find the mysql.socket Unix domain
        socket file.

        Future versions of the library are under the GPL and thus we don&#039;t
        have an upgrade path since we cannot bundle a GPL&#039;ed library in a

      This won&#039;t actually affect that many people.  Unix users, at least the
      ones who know what they are doing, tend to always build PHP against
      their system&#039;s libmysqlclient library simply by adding the <strong class="option configure">--with-mysql=/usr</strong>
 option
      when building PHP.  Windows users may enable the extension
      <var class="filename">php_mysql.dll</var> inside <var class="filename">php.ini</var>.
      For more details, see the <a href="ref.mysql.html" class="link">MySQL Reference</a>
      for installation instructions. Also, be sure
      <var class="filename">libmysql.dll</var> is available to the systems PATH.
      For more details on how, read the FAQ on
      <a href="faq.installation.html#faq.installation.addtopath" class="link">setting up the Windows
      systems PATH</a>.  Because <var class="filename">libmysql.dll</var> (and
      many other PHP related files) exist in the PHP folder, you&#039;ll want to
      add the PHP folder to your systems PATH.

      If your MySQL libs are linked against pthreads this will happen. Check
